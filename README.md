Visualize kalman filter.  
A click on the canvas is the true position(red), and a noise measurement is made(blue).  
A kalman filter with a constant velocity-model tries to estimate the true position utilizing both  
the noisy measurements and its internal model. The estimated position is shown in green.  


## use:
in python env:  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python app.py

## todo:
- [ ] Frame below canvas not appearing until first click  
- [ ] Better text formatting    
- [ ] Better init of KF
